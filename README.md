Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands, a prominent player in the Indian hospitality industry with a two-decade presence and a chain of luxury hotels, is facing a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels segment. This decline can be attributed to strategic maneuvers by competitors and suboptimal decision-making within the management. In response, the managing director of Atliq Grands aims to revitalize the business by integrating "Business and Data Intelligence." However, the lack of an in-house data analytics team necessitates the engagement of a third-party service provider to extract valuable insights from historical data.
